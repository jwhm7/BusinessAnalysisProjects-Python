## [Target Marketing ML Model]

### ㆍ Summary
Identified the best working ML algorithm and hyperparameter in deriving a marketing target.
<br/>
<br/>
### ㆍ Process
Data Preprocessing ➔ Experiment Classification Models ➔ Tune Hyperparameters ➔ Conclusion
<br/>

### ㆍ Used Algorithms/Methods
▸ Basic Model : DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier
<br/>
▸ Hyperparameter Tuning : GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV
<br/>
<br/>
### ㆍ Conclusion
▸ The RandomForestClassifier model without hyperparameter tuning showed the highest model accuracy and f1-score.
<br/>
&ensp; All of the classification report scores were well-balanced.
