# [Target Marketing ML Model]

### ㆍ Summary

Identified the best working ML algorithm and hyperparameter in deriving a marketing target.

### ㆍ Process

Data Preprocessing ➔ Experiment Classification Models ➔ Tune Hyperparameters ➔ Conclusion

### ㆍ Used Algorithms/Methods

▸ Basic Model : DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier
<br/>
▸ Hyperparameter Tuning : GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV

### ㆍ Conclusion

▸ The RandomForestClassifier model without hyperparameter tuning showed the highest model accuracy and f1-score.
<br/>
&ensp; All of the classification report scores were well-balanced.
