# [Homesite Quote Conversion, Which Customers Will Purchase A ]

### ㆍ Summary

Experimented 5 ML algorithms with SMOTE, stacking, and hyperparameter tuning to find the best model predicting which customers will purchase a given quoted price.

### ㆍ Process

Basic Models ➔ Implement SMOTE with Different Ratios ➔ Perform Stacking and Hyperparameter Tuning ➔ Conclusion

### ㆍ Used Algorithms/Methods

▸ Basic Model : DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, LinearSCMClassifier, MultiLayerPerceptron, KNeighborClassifier
<br/>
▸ Finding Important Features : roc_auc_score, xgboost, plot_importance
<br/>
▸ Improving Model : SMOTE, GridSearchCV

### ㆍ Conclusion

▸ The DecisionTreeClassifier model with optimized random_state and parameter showed the highest Kaggle score among 6 models.
<br/>
▸ The model accuracy was the highest with the basic model.
